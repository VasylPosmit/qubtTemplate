## Purpose of Documenting the Tech Stack

### Why Document This?
1. **Portfolio of Decision-Making**:
   - Demonstrates my ability to assess, select, and justify technology choices in a structured and analytical manner.
   - Showcases not just technical skills but also strategic thinking in balancing requirements, constraints, and outcomes.

2. **LLM Reference and Analysis**:
   - Provides a detailed record of decisions for future AI-driven analysis or assistance.
   - Captures a structured workflow that can be used as a template for similar projects.

3. **Human Reference (Journaling)**:
   - Serves as a personal log for reflecting on and learning from this project.
   - Documents both successes and trade-offs for future reference.

## Process Summary: How I Chose Hugo + Qubt Theme

### 1. Defining the Purpose of the Site
- **Core Objective**: Build a personal site to own my online presence, host original content (articles, essays, and portfolio pieces), and reflect my professional identity.
- **Portfolio Applications**: Initially considered integrating portfolio applications (e.g., LLM-based functionality) directly into the site.
  - **Decision**: Based on purpose and clarity, I chose to separate portfolio applications as a distinct project. This simplification reduced the complexity of the personal site and led to the rejection of a front-end framework like React.

---

### 2. Tech and Content Analysis
- Conducted **content analysis** to clarify why I need the site:
  - To consolidate my Medium articles, professional projects, and principles into a single, unified platform.
  - To create a lightweight, responsive site that aligns with my values and professional goals.
- Reviewed examples like [Dario Amodei's site](https://darioamodei.com/) for inspiration in simplicity, organisation, and clarity.

---

### 3. Technology Evaluation
- **React (and Next.js)**:
  - Initially considered for flexibility and interactivity.
  - **Rejected**: Overkill for a static personal site. Simplifying requirements (due to separating portfolio apps) made a front-end framework unnecessary.
  
- **Static Site Generators**:
  - Evaluated **Jekyll**, **Eleventy**, and **Hugo**:
    - Jekyll: Ruby-based with dependency management issues; required plugins for essential features.
    - Eleventy: Lightweight but lacked built-in features for larger scalability.
    - **Hugo**: Chosen for:
      - Speed and ease of use for static content.
      - Markdown-first approach and native features (e.g., Table of Contents, taxonomies).
      - **LLM Support**: Hugo's comprehensive documentation made it easier to leverage GPT for assistance, ensuring rapid problem-solving and efficient development.

### 4. Theme Selection
- **Qubt Theme** chosen for:
  - Minimalist and professional design.
  - Built-in responsiveness and navigation.
  - Alignment with my desired content structure.

---

## Outcomes
- **Rapid Development**: The site was built and deployed in **8 working hours**, including installing tools from scratch (clean laptop) and leveraging AI assistance.
- **Efficient Workflow**: This time includes analysis, decision-making, and documenting the process, showcasing a high-leverage use of AI tools and focused development.

## Conclusion
By clarifying the purpose and separating portfolio applications as a distinct project, I simplified the personal site's requirements and rejected unnecessary complexity (e.g., React). Hugo + Qubt Theme emerged as a pragmatic choice due to its speed, built-in features, and compatibility with AI support. This solution allowed for a rapid build with minimal overhead while achieving all content and technical goals.
