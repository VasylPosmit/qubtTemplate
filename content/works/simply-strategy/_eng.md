# Simply Strategy

*This essay is a starting point available to anyone: how to get the basics right and make strategy useful.*

## Prologue: Confusion Over Strategy

Strategy is among the most overused yet least understood terms of our time. It is invoked as a solution to everything—from organisational success to personal growth—yet its meaning remains elusive. For something so frequently tied to achievement, this lack of clarity is costly, breeding inefficiency and muddled thinking.

The problem lies in its misuse: it is either overcomplicated, buried under layers of jargon and exclusivity, or oversimplified—reduced to a vague notion of 'smart ways to get things done'. Both perspectives fail to capture its true depth and purpose. At its core, strategy is a way of changing the principles of action to achieve higher-quality results. This essay results from abstracting different forms and uses of strategy into their essential elements, aiming to provide a universal entry point that offers clarity without chasing exhaustive details.

To address this confusion, I aim to simplify and clarify the concept of strategy, stripping away its semantic mess and distilling it into accessible, practical terms. The goal is to provide a clear understanding that serves as a viable reference point, offering clarity without complications. I hope this foundation is close enough to the nature of the phenomenon to support further understanding and practical usage.

In the seven sections ahead, I will explore the following angles on strategy:

1. **EFFICIENCY BOOST**: How to solve the ambition-scarcity-unpredictability problem.
2. **A SOLUTION FOR GREATER THINGS**: Mechanism behind unprecedented achievement.
3. **COST OF SWITCHING**: The unavoidable cost of balancing the tension between focus and adaptability.
4. **USE CASE**: When to apply and when to abstain.
5. **INSIDE THE STRATEGIST’S MIND**: Core practices—clarity, sense-making, planning, learning, and attention control.
6. **FRESHLY ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE**: From the skill of rulers to a universally accessible tool for intentional and impactful action.
7. **APPLICATIONS**: Practical implications and takeaways.

Let’s begin.

## EFFICIENCY BOOST

*Strategy boosts efficiency through attention control, clarity of intention, making sense of situations, prescribing next steps, and learning from outcomes to effectively manage scarce resources under unpredictable conditions.*

---

### Problem Statement

**Strategy is the solution to the problem that arises from the concurrent presence of ambition, scarcity, and unpredictability.**

Resources like time, finances, and support are finite, while needs are not. This mismatch creates a constant challenge where bold ambitions face the reality of limited resources. Strategy addresses these efficiency deficiencies—situations where no known method yields the desired results. Among several viable options, I choose to focus on strategy because it is specifically designed to overcome these challenges.

Managing scarcity is a nontrivial task, and accumulating or effectively deploying resources takes time. This need for time, combined with the uncertainty introduced by unprecedented ambition, results in unpredictability—the impossibility to predict what will happen or how it will unfold.

#### Approaches to Boost Efficiency

Strategy is an efficiency boost approach designed to solve the problem of scarcity.
When ambition exceeds available resources, and there aren't enough means to start directly, we are left asking 'how can it be done?'. The answer lies in finding methods to act more efficiently while also handling continuously changing conditions.

There are two particular approaches which address the scarcity problem: 

1. **Research** is technical, involving the invention of new methods.
2. **Strategy** is organisational, focused on leveraging existing methods and resources to achieve otherwise unattainable results.

Both approaches demand significant effort, continuous learning, and originality.

- **Research** is about truth discovery and understanding its implications. Figuring out new truths is indeed hard; therefore, we normally do not expect a high success rate, especially when we choose it for ourselves.

- **Strategy** is about creating value: how to make more value with each action compared to before. Immediate value and intermediate progress make strategy particularly appealing. It is about ingenuity and practicality—'how to get more by moving less'—which aligns with our instinctive preference for efficiency, even before realising the mental effort involved.

### Way of Strategy

**So, what exactly is the way of strategy?** Here is a concise overview before we dive into the details.

Strategy involves consistently directing attention toward intentions, making sense of the situation, deciding on next steps, and learning from actions to maximise progress. At its core, it is about enhancing utility and advancing steadily despite challenges.

**Attention Control**  
Attention control is the foundation of this approach. It ensures consistency in pursuing what must be done rather than what merely seems appealing. Sustaining focus in today’s distraction-filled world is a massive challenge—there’s no quick fix or symptomatic treatment. Outstanding results require sustained effort over time.

**Clarity of Intention**  
Clarity of intention means defining desired outcomes from multiple perspectives. It is not only about self-awareness but also about broadening opportunities while safeguarding identity. In our modern world, the rise of democratic society and information technology provides unprecedented freedom. However, this also means facing an overload of information—junk, ads, and propaganda. Refining intentions helps to stay on course and avoid pursuing what is not genuinely wanted.

**Making Sense**  
Making sense involves identifying what truly matters in both the environment and oneself. Amid the endless stream of information, it is essential to shortlist significant factors that align with the cause, effectively filtering out the noise. This becomes a personal dashboard, guiding attention to what is important.

**Envisioning**
Envisioning means summarising the situation and considering possible actions based on known cause-and-effect relationships. It goes beyond mere planning; it prescribes the next steps while embracing the learning that comes from each action. This dynamic process allows adaptation and refinement of the approach based on real-world feedback.

**Learning in Practice**

Learning in practice is the continuous reflection and adaptation that this approach demands. It’s not about planning every step in advance but about evaluating the outcomes of your current actions and adjusting accordingly. Reality often defies theoretical expectations, so staying open and confident in the face of uncertainty is crucial. Embrace what works, amend what doesn’t, and keep building your toolkit.


**These four facets are the essence of strategy.**

Their ongoing interaction creates an efficiency boost that directly tackles scarcity. By aligning these components effectively, this method transcends mere resource management. It becomes a powerful tool that pushes us beyond our limits, enabling us to achieve what once seemed impossible. This is how strategy evolves from enhancing efficiency to becoming a pathway to remarkable accomplishments.

## SOLUTION FOR GREATER THINGS

*Strategy transforms ambition into tangible results, consistently surpassing personal standards even under scarcity and uncertainty.*

---

Smart individuals often intuitively solve complex problems by engaging directly with challenges, naturally developing effective methods. This makes me wonder if there's an underlying universal pattern waiting to be revealed—one that we could all benefit from if it's simply and clearly formulated.
Recognizing that strategy addresses the problem of ambition, scarcity, and unpredictability, I find it essential to explore how these elements intertwine, starting with the deeply personal nature of ambition.  

**Personal Ambition**  
Ambition is inherently subjective. What feels monumental to me might seem trivial to someone else, depending on our respective resources and experiences. Strategy, then, is about achieving results that are significant and impressive within our own realm of possibility.  

Pursuing our potential means reaching for ambitions that surpass our previous standards. By consistently outdoing ourselves, we edge closer to the outer limits of human capability—a frontier universally recognized and admired.
When we push beyond these boundaries, we touch the essence of greatness. Achievements that exceed our own expectations become impressive to everyone.  

**Facing Scarcity and Uncertainty**  
Scarcity—lacking the means, skills, or experience to achieve our goals—is a feeling many of us, especially recent graduates, know all too well. Uncertainty arises when we're unsure about our situation, the rules, or the best course of action. This is the reality we often face in complex, real-world scenarios.  

Yet, despite these challenges, we move forward with partial knowledge and preparation. In this context, I am fascinated by the story of Imhotep, a figure who masterfully navigated scarcity and uncertainty and own ambitions.

### Imhotep\'s Legacy
Around 4,700 years ago, during Egypt's Third Dynasty, the nation's boundaries were naturally defined by deserts and the Nile River. After the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, Pharaoh Djoser's reign marked a pivotal shift from territorial expansion to internal consolidation. Recognizing the diminishing returns of conquest, Djoser and his vizier Imhotep focused on strengthening the state's foundations.  

Imhotep conceived an unprecedented endeavor: constructing the Step Pyramid at the Sahara. This was more than an architectural project—it was a nuanced approach to unify the populace and reinforce the Pharaoh’s divine authority. By bringing together artisans, laborers, and craftsmen from across the kingdom, he created a cultural melting pot, much like an army unites diverse individuals for collective effort and social mobility. Here, unification was forged through collective creation.
The ambitious project required innovative techniques, meticulous planning, and coordinated effort over nearly two decades. Imhotep pioneered the use of limestone blocks on a massive scale, symbolizing permanence and the eternal nature of Djoser's rule.  

By centralizing resources and labor, Imhotep mobilized a workforce while ensuring agricultural productivity remained unaffected. He expertly managed the logistics of transporting massive stone blocks, orchestrating one of history's earliest large-scale construction projects.  

The outcomes were profound. The Step Pyramid stood as a testament to architectural innovation and served as a unifying symbol for a consolidated Egypt. It solidified Pharaoh Djoser's divine status, embodying his godly authority and securing support from religious and political elites. Remarkably, Imhotep maintained his influence as the second most powerful man in Egypt, skillfully navigating the perils of court politics.  

In what I might call 'god-level' stakeholder management, Imhotep aligned his ambitions with the greater goals of the state and the Pharaoh. By glorifying Djoser and advancing the kingdom's stability, he elevated his own legacy—eventually being deified himself as a god of wisdom, medicine, and architecture. His story exemplifies how nuanced approaches can solve greater challenges, showing that true brilliance lies in benefiting the whole while subtly securing one's place in history.
We know almost nothing about him as a person—even his birth name is unknown—but the driving force he embodied was remembered by generations as Imhotep, which means The One Who Came in Peace.  

Owning a singular, grand strategy places a strategist on the path to embody a great ambition.

## COGNITIVE COSTS

*Strategy demands attention. But attention is finite, making its cost inevitable. Awareness must precede application.*

---

**Cost of Switching Attention**  
Achieving ambitions greater than oneself demands not only vision and action but also an acute awareness of trade-offs. Among these, the most critical and often overlooked cost is that of attention—the finite cognitive resource that fuels both focused execution and adaptation to new inputs.

**Attention Tax**

Strategy exacts a portion of mental bandwidth to ensure control and alignment of attention. This 'attention tax' necessitates allocating a noticeable tithe (tenth) of the cognitive energy to planning, reflecting, and adjusting. The majority of effort remains dedicated to practical action—getting hands dirty in the real work—but this mental overhead is non-negotiable. It is a matter of balance: without allocating this tithe, action risks becoming blind effort; while with it, there is a cost of taking the time to think, consolidate, and act thoughtfully.

**Iterative Gains**

The benefits of this approach are neither delayed nor static; they compound. Each iteration—each plan, action, and adjustment—produces incremental productivity gains that, over time, far outweigh the attention invested. Unlike a long-term academic commitment where rewards come years later, strategy operates on a shorter feedback loop. With every iteration, learning sharpens execution, and cumulative gains grow.

However, attention is finite. It can deplete through time constraints, fatigue, loss of motivation, or even a fading sense of purpose. This is why understanding the cost of attention is crucial: it allows one to be deliberate in deciding whether the benefits of this tool outweigh its demands.

**Balancing Focus and Flexibility**

Employing strategy introduces a challenge: the need to balance focused attention with the flexibility to adapt. On one hand, focus is essential for maintaining discipline, ensuring tasks are carried out efficiently. On the other, strategy requires frequent shifts in attention—to evaluate, plan, and course-correct. These shifts, or what I call 'switching', are not without their price.


**Cognitive Costs of Switching**

Every time attention switches, there’s a cognitive cost. Re-engaging with a new context or rebuilding mental momentum after a shift demands energy. Studies repeatedly highlight the productivity losses associated with multitasking—each transition erodes efficiency by up to 40% (Rubinstein, Meyer, & Evans, 2001). Moving between execution and planning, then back to action, mirrors this challenge.

This underlying tension means that attention must be both focused and switchable. Over-focusing risks rigidity, where unwillingness to adapt compromises effectiveness. Conversely, over-switching results in scattered effort and diminished impact. Mastery lies in navigating this tension with awareness.

**Adaptability Takes Effort**

Adaptability requires more than just possessing the right traits; adaptation demands conscious effort. Strategy is not a pre-packaged plan; it is a dynamic process, constantly reshaped by new insights, evolving goals, and shifting circumstances. Reflection and reassessment are built into its nature. However, this requires effort—effort that can feel inconvenient when deep focus feels productive. Routines, while increasing efficiency, can also create blind spots, making flexibility harder to reclaim when needed.

**Mastering Attention Control**

For the strategist, the ultimate skill is attention control—the ability to master both focus and switching. These are not opposites but complementary aspects of a well-managed cognitive toolkit. Even when honed, this balance incurs its own 'attention tax', a mental effort that cannot be avoided.

The key is mindfulness: apply the tool only when its benefits outweigh its costs.

So, when is it worth using?
