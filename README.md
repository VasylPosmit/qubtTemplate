# Welcome ü§ó 
This is the repo for Vasyl Posmit's personal site.

The site is deployed to GitHub Pages and available at: [vasylposmit.com](https://vasylposmit.com/)

## Approach

The technical implementation of this site was to build it as fast as possible with maximum leverage of AI tools. The initial version was built and deployed in 8 working hours with zero previous experience with Hugo and a clean laptop, which required installing everything, including the IDE.

## Documentation

Key technical considerations are documented under the [project-log](project-log/) folder.
