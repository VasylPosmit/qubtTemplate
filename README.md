# Welcome ü§ó 
This is the repo for Vasyl Posmit's personal site.

It is deployed to GitHub Pages: [https://VasylPosmit.github.io/vp](https://VasylPosmit.github.io/vp)

## Approach

The technical implementation of this site was to build it as fast as possible with maximum leverage of AI tools. The initial version was built and deployed in 8 working hours with zero previous experience with Hugo and a clean laptop, which required installing everything, including the IDE.

## Documentation

Key technical considerations are documented under the [meta](meta/) folder.
